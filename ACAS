##Notes for ACAS
## Assured Compliance Assessment Solution (ACAS) (DoD ACAS)##
## Nessus ; Passive Vulnerability Scanner ; Security Center ##
## A compliance program; not an application ~ DoD ACAS replacement for Secure Configuration Compliance Validation Initiative ##
## Security Center replaced REM ~ Nessus replaced Retina Scanner ~ Passive Vulnerability Scanner (new) ##
## PVS should be installed where your NIDS/NIPS systems are or would be deployed ##
## PVS requires a separate license for each instance from DISA. Not currrently required to deploy, but should be deployed at the subnet level when cost validates. ##
## ACAS requires two accounts - admin accounts for configuration and management of ACAS apps/zones; user accounts provide scanning and reporting functions only ##
## Organizations are created on need of separation. Only one SuperUser can be Org Head. Others can have same permissions, but not be an Org Head. ##
## Scan zones ~ separation of duties and corresponding buckets of information ##
## ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) Server ~ enhanced reporting session ##
## First monitor indicates McAfee Agent is installed and checked-in within the last X days (10 default) ##
